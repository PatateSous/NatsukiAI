NatsukiAI is a robot that i made entirely, and is not for distribution, if someone claims that they have a copy a NatsukiAI, it's false. 

NatsukiAI is made to produce custom replays, and shouldn't influence cheating whatsoever, as it's just a bot like the "Auto" mod, but that i tried adding "human aim", "human tapping" and other "human" things to it, like normal UR, or anything like that.

NatsukiAI is in the hands of only my very close friends, so if that person is someone I DON'T KNOW, they're lying, and also they won't distribute it, 100%.

Indepth video of how NatsukiAI works : https://youtu.be/7awJHovOTAc




So, you might ask :

"Why won't you release it ?" 

And the answer is that i would, but i'm scared it would help some people cheat kind of "legit", which i really don't want happening, yes of course right now the aim is kinda back, but imagine later when it could be fixed and really smooth, i don't want people to cheat using MY software.

"Why Natsuki ?"

Because i've loved Natsuki since forever, and i don't see why not >.< (best ddlc girl)

"How are scores posted ?"

I use danser, and also my software, and it's pretty easy, if i'm honest, the hardest thing is probably the thumbnail! 

Steps to get a NatsukiAI video out :



-Launch NatsukiAI and generate replay

-Danser render

-Thumbnail render

-Upload

-Yippie!



Either way, i hope you love the website i made for my little project, it's super basic, but it's better than plain text!
